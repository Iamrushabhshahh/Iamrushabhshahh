# Everything is an Engineering Problem

_"Everything we see is an engineering problem yet to be solved."_

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
Iâ€™m **Rushabh** â€“ a DevOps Engineer (or at least thatâ€™s what the job title says).  
I automate things, break things, fix things... and sometimes doubt what I just did.

### ðŸ›  What I Do
- CI/CD, Containers, Clouds, and Coffee.
- Favorite command: `it works on my machine`.

### ðŸ˜‚ Fun Fact
I do something... I doubt.

### ðŸš€ Contribution
PRs are welcome, but remember:  
**With great power comes great `git push --force`.**
